Task 1: Updated the Investments FAQ agent instructions in `python-backend/airline/agents.py` to make it respond as a human expert rather than an AI agent - removed references to knowledge bases, sources, and phrases like "the info provided says", while keeping the file_search tool functionality working silently in the background.

Task 2: Created `check_call_availability` tool in `python-backend/airline/tools.py` that checks day of week (no calls on Sunday), calculates availability window (11:00 Israel time to 20:00 Guatemala time converted to UTC), and returns JSON with service status. Updated Scheduling Agent instructions to use this tool and follow priority flow: 20 minutes → 2-4 hours → Calendly MCP fallback.
