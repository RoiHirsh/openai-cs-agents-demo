# Progress Log

This file tracks the completion of tasks from tasks.md. Each entry should be a short sentence summarizing what task was tackled and how it was completed.

---

Task 1: Updated the Investments FAQ agent instructions in `python-backend/airline/agents.py` to make it respond as a human expert rather than an AI agent - removed references to knowledge bases, sources, and phrases like "the info provided says", while keeping the file_search tool functionality working silently in the background.

Task 2: Created `check_call_availability` tool in `python-backend/airline/tools.py` that checks day of week (no calls on Sunday), calculates availability window (11:00 Israel time to 20:00 Guatemala time converted to UTC), and returns JSON with service status. Updated Scheduling Agent instructions to use this tool and follow priority flow: 20 minutes → 2-4 hours → Calendly MCP fallback.

Task 3: Updated the relevance guardrail instructions in `python-backend/airline/guardrails.py` to focus on financing trading bot services and related topics (onboarding, account info, broker setups, trading strategies, etc.) instead of airline topics, and to block unrelated topics including airline travel questions.

Task 4: Updated the initial conversation greeting and buttons in `ui/components/chatkit-panel.tsx` to show Perry's introduction message from Lucentive Club and replaced the three airline-related buttons with two buttons ("Chat" and "Call") that send "chat" and "call" messages respectively.

Task 5: Created LeadInfoModal component that appears on page load with randomized lead data (name, email, phone, country). Updated context model to include lead fields (first_name, email, phone, country, new_lead). Modified page.tsx to show modal and pass lead data to chat system. Updated ChatKitPanel to personalize greeting with first name ("Hi {firstname}!"). Updated server to accept lead data via bootstrap endpoint and set it in conversation context. Lead variables (first_name, country, new_lead) are now displayed in the conversation context section.
